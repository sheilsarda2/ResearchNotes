# CHANGELOG

## 2026-08-27 — Node 0.5.1

- Node `@russellthehippo/honker-node`: 0.5.1, with the four
  `honker-node-<platform>` packages moved to 0.5.1 alongside it. The fix
  is JavaScript only and the Rust addon is unchanged, but the loader
  pins the native package version exactly, so the natives release in
  lockstep. `honker-ext-<platform>` is untouched and stays at 0.4.6.
- `claimWaker().next()` no longer parks on `idlePollS` after a `runAt`
  deadline it was waiting for has passed. `honker_queue_next_claim_at`
  only reports deadlines still in the future, so it returns 0 the moment
  one arrives; if the claim taken at that instant came back empty — a
  writer holding the lock past the 5 s `busy_timeout`, or another worker
  taking the row — the waker had nothing to park on and slept the whole
  idle interval on a queue with claimable work. A worker using `runAt`
  with a long `idlePollS` could stall well past its deadline under write
  contention. The waker now retries briefly instead. A queue that was
  never waiting on a deadline polls exactly as before.
- Regression test claims a job at a deadline with one claim forced to
  return empty: it fails on the unpatched `api.js` and passes on the fix.

## Unreleased — Node checkpoint interoperability (Phase Robinson)

- Node stream checkpoint calls now use the shared SQL ABI's canonical
  `(consumer, topic)` key order, so `saveOffset`, `saveOffsetTx`, `getOffset`,
  `readFromConsumer`, and `subscribe` interoperate with every other binding.
- Checkpoints written by Node 0.4.6 migrate automatically on first access when
  their saved offset can be verified against a retained event in the requested
  stream. The migration is transactional, canonical state wins, and the old
  row remains available for rollback.
- Unverifiable alpha-era checkpoint state fails with
  `CheckpointMigrationError` on reads instead of silently replaying or skipping
  events. An explicit `saveOffset` or `saveOffsetTx` establishes canonical
  progress, so resetting to zero never requires raw SQL. Concurrent use of Node
  0.4.6 and a corrected release for the same consumer is unsupported during
  upgrade.
- Cross-runtime tests publish real events and prove Python→Node and Node→Python
  named-consumer resume, Node subscription persistence, legacy 0.4.6 migration,
  and transactional commit/rollback.
- The Node package and its platform-native packages advance to 0.5.0 for this
  on-disk resume behavior change.

## Unreleased — extension reach for every binding (Phase Beavis)

Closes issue #99. Every binding could `open()` a database; almost none
could tell you where the loadable extension is, which is what you need
to load Honker onto a connection you already own. Enqueueing outside
your app's transaction loses atomicity, so that is the whole reason ORM
users reach for the extension.

- New `@russellthehippo/honker-ext-<platform>` npm packages carrying
  `libhonker_ext`, pulled in by `honker-node` and `honker-bun` through
  `optionalDependencies`. No extra install step.
- `extensionPath()` / `extensionInfo()` in Node and Bun. Pure
  JavaScript: resolving a path must not load the napi addon and drag a
  second statically linked SQLite into a process that already has
  better-sqlite3's.
- `HonkerExtension.Locate()` (.NET) and `dev.honker.HonkerExtension
  .path()` (JVM, inherited by Kotlin). Both packages already bundled
  the extension and knew how to find it; the resolvers were private.
- `honker.ExtensionPath()` (Go) and `Honker.Extension.path/0` (Elixir).
  Neither ecosystem can ship a binary, so these read
  `HONKER_EXTENSION_PATH` and otherwise error with every path tried and
  the release URL.
- `release-extension.yml` publishes `libhonker_ext` for five targets to
  GitHub Releases on `ext-v*` tags. The repo had none, while three doc
  pages told people to download from a release page.
- Depends on the `REAL` argument coercion in PR #101. `better-sqlite3`
  binds every JavaScript number as `REAL`, so without it the `Queue`
  wrapper published on honker.dev fails on its first call with
  `Invalid function parameter type Real at index 4`. The acceptance
  proof here binds its parameters and fails without that change, which
  is the intended ordering.
- The contract is written down in `BINDINGS.md`:
  `HONKER_EXTENSION_PATH`, then bundled, then a loud error; entrypoint
  always `sqlite3_honkerext_init`; the accessor never loads native code.

Proof: `scripts/proof/node-orm-extension.sh` installs the packed
tarballs into a clean project with `better-sqlite3` and runs the
shared ORM SQL surface (queue, stream, notify, scheduler, lock, rate
limit, result) plus an ORM-owned commit/rollback of a business write
with `honker_enqueue`. Every numeric argument is bound rather than
written as a literal. Both `ci.yml` and `release-node.yml` call it,
so PRs run the same check that gates a release. It reads nothing from
`target/release` and has no skip path, unlike
`tests/test_extension_interop.py`, which skips when the build tree is
empty and is how this shipped broken. The same surface catalog drives
every other documented ORM recipe in CI, including the Rust sqlx, SeaORM,
and Diesel recipes. Toasty is documented as unable to load SQLite
extensions today, so it has no recipe and no CI proof.

Publish order, which the `optionalDependencies` pins require: the four
`honker-ext-*` packages first, then `honker-node@0.4.6` and
`honker-bun@0.4.2`. `scripts/proof/check-ext-version-alignment.py`
guards the pins.

## Unreleased — schedule lifecycle + job cancel (Phase Mantle)

Shipped in PR #42. Closes issue #25, with the deliberate "no `max_runs`"
stance recorded in the phase entry that drove it.

- New `enabled` column on `_honker_scheduler_tasks`. Both the scheduler
  tick and `soonest()` filter on `enabled = 1`, so a paused schedule
  neither emits nor holds the wake deadline.
- New SQL functions: `honker_scheduler_pause`, `honker_scheduler_resume`,
  `honker_scheduler_list`, `honker_scheduler_update`, `honker_cancel`,
  and `honker_get_job`. (`remove()` goes through the pre-existing
  `honker_scheduler_unregister`.)
  Lifecycle methods go through these rather than binding-local state, so
  they operate on rows registered by another process (CLI tool, admin
  script, MCP wrapper).
- Scheduler lifecycle methods, namespaced on the scheduler handle rather
  than flattened onto the database handle: `pause(name)`,
  `resume(name)`, `remove(name)`, `list()`, and
  `update(name, *, schedule=None, payload=..., priority=None,
  expires=...)`. `update` recomputes `next_fire_at` from now when the
  schedule expression changes, and distinguishes "set to JSON null"
  from "leave unchanged" by omitted kwarg.
- Job lifecycle on the queue handle: `cancel(job_id)` removes a pending
  or processing row and returns whether one was removed; `get_job(job_id)`
  is a pure read. Cancelling a claimed-but-unacked job makes the worker's
  later `ack()` a no-op, matching expired-claim semantics.
- Wired through nine bindings — Python, Node, Rust, Go, Bun, Ruby,
  Elixir, C++, and .NET — each with a binding-local round-trip proof,
  not just the three bindings originally scoped. JVM and Kotlin do not
  yet expose the Mantle lifecycle methods.

## Unreleased — correctness priority fixes

Experimental wake backends:

- **`kernel-watcher` no longer drops SQLite's POSIX locks (#80).** On
  macOS the kqueue backend held an `O_EVTONLY` descriptor on the main
  database file and `-shm`, and closed it on `NOTE_DELETE` pruning, on
  attach failure, and at watcher shutdown. Closing any descriptor for an
  inode releases every advisory lock the *process* holds on it, and those
  two files are exactly the ones SQLite locks in WAL mode. The result was
  a live connection whose `-wal`/`-shm` another process could delete —
  making the next `COMMIT` return `SQLITE_OK` into an unlinked WAL, where
  it was silently and permanently lost — or a `-shm` truncated under a
  live mapping, which is the SIGBUS (exit 138) seen in CI. The backend
  now watches only the parent directory, `-wal`, and `-journal`: files
  SQLite opens with `UNIXFILE_NOLOCK` and therefore never locks. WAL
  commit detection is unchanged. Also applied on the BSDs, where
  `notify`'s recommended watcher is kqueue-based; Linux (inotify) and
  Windows are unaffected and unchanged.
- **`shm-fast-path` no longer releases SQLite's WAL-index locks (#80).**
  Same root cause, different code path. Its `probe()` opened and closed
  `-shm` on every `honker.open()` — after the writer connection already
  existed, so it dropped the process's WAL-index locks once per open with
  no churn needed — and the watcher's own descriptor was closed on reopen
  and at shutdown. Losing those locks doesn't reap the WAL (the database
  file's SHARED lock still blocks that); it lets a fresh connection win
  the deadman race and truncate `-shm` under a live mapping, which is the
  SIGBUS. `-shm` descriptors now come from a registry that opens each
  inode once and only closes one whose `st_nlink` is 0 — provably
  unreferenced, so there is no lock left to drop. PR #43's bounded-read
  protection is unchanged.
- **The shm fast path is slower than its docs claimed, and is no longer
  recommended.** PR #43 replaced the mmap load with a bounded read,
  citing SIGBUS risk. That risk was overstated for this particular read:
  SQLite truncates `-shm` to 3 bytes rather than 0, and `iChange` at
  offset 8 falls inside the partial page POSIX guarantees is readable.
  The SIGBUS seen in CI came from SQLite's own mapping, because honker
  was dropping SQLite's DMS lock — the bug fixed above. The bounded read
  stays regardless, because restoring the mapping would not help:
  `pread` of the header is ~1.2 us versus ~2.3 us for `PRAGMA
  data_version` on macOS/arm64, and both backends sleep 1 ms, so **wake
  latency is identical**. Trading CPU for latency is already available on
  the polling backend via the poll-interval option. Prefer polling.

Core (all bindings via `honker_*` SQL / shared extension):

- **Claim/reclaim honors `max_attempts`.** Exhausted reclaimable jobs
  move to `_honker_dead` with `last_error='max attempts exceeded'`
  instead of being reclaimed forever after a worker dies without
  `retry()`/`ack()`.
- **No synthetic wake rows** on enqueue, retry, stream publish, or
  scheduler register. Workers wake on `PRAGMA data_version` from the
  real table write. `notify()` still writes `_honker_notifications`
  for real pub/sub. Do **not** `listen('honker:<queue>')` expecting
  enqueue traffic — use `queue.claim` / `update_events`.
- **`honker_lock_renew(name, owner, ttl_s)`** refreshes lock TTL for
  the current owner. `honker_lock_acquire` never did; heartbeats that
  called acquire were no-ops for TTL. Bindings use renew for lock /
  scheduler heartbeats.
- **Job heartbeat** requires a still-valid `claim_expires_at` so a
  late heartbeat cannot steal a job back after visibility timeout.
- **Scheduler catch-up cap:** at most 64 fires per task per
  `honker_scheduler_tick`. Further missed boundaries are **skipped**
  (`next_fire_at` jumps past now). Run the scheduler continuously if
  every missed fire must land.
- **Scheduler tasks store `max_attempts`** (default 3; 7-arg
  `honker_scheduler_register`). Tick uses that budget instead of a
  hardcoded 3.
- **JSON returns** from claim/get_job/scheduler/stream built with
  `serde_json` (wire shape for string payloads unchanged).
- **Notification `max_keep` pruning is gap-safe** in Python, Node,
  Rust, JVM, and .NET. The bindings now retain the newest N rows by
  rank instead of assuming notification IDs are contiguous;
  `max_keep=0` deletes all rows and negative values are rejected.

Python:

- `@task(retries=N)` pins row `max_attempts` and is honored by
  `run_workers` via shared `_worker.run_task`.
- `db.queue(name)` with **no** options is pure lookup; explicit
  conflicting options raise. `Scheduler.run` raises
  `LeadershipLost` when the leader lock is stolen; ownership is
  re-checked every tick.

## 2026-05-28 — .NET 0.2.4

- .NET `Honker`: 0.2.4
- NuGet packages now bundle Honker native extension assets for
  `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `osx-x64`, `osx-arm64`, and `win-x64`.
- New `Release · NuGet` workflow builds each native asset on a matching
  runner, combines them into one package, verifies the package contents,
  smoke-tests a consumer app, and publishes on `dotnet-v*` tags.

## 2026-05-23 — Ruby 0.3.0

- Ruby `honker`: 0.3.0
- New `Honker::Railtie` runs `honker_bootstrap()` against
  `ActiveRecord::Base.connection` in `config.after_initialize`, so Rails
  apps no longer need a hand-written initializer. Loaded conditionally,
  so Rails remains a non-dependency.
- New module-level helpers collapse the extension-load + bootstrap
  ceremony every ORM integration was copy-pasting: `Honker.extension_path`,
  `Honker.load_extension`, `Honker.bootstrap`, `Honker.setup`, and
  `Honker.sequel_after_connect` (a ready-made proc for Sequel/Rom/Hanami
  `after_connect:`).

## 2026-05-20 - Ruby 0.2.0

- Ruby `honker`: 0.2.0
- Ruby gems now bundle the Honker SQLite loadable extension. Precompiled
  gems ship the native library for x86_64 Linux, arm64 Linux, and Apple
  Silicon macOS, so `Honker::Database.new` resolves it automatically and
  `extension_path:` is now optional. On every other platform, and for
  `github:` installs, the generic gem compiles the extension from
  bundled Rust source on install (a Rust toolchain is required).
- New `Release · RubyGems` workflow builds and smoke-tests those gems;
  the release proof rejects platform gems missing the bundled extension.

## 2026-05-20 — Python 0.2.5

- Python `honker`: 0.2.5
- Python wheels now use the CPython stable ABI for Python 3.11+, so
  each OS/arch wheel covers Python 3.11 through 3.14 instead of forcing
  unsupported interpreters to fall back to source installs.
- Python release proof now rejects wheels missing the bundled Honker
  SQLite loadable extension.

## 2026-05-20 — Python 0.2.4

- Python `honker`: 0.2.4
- Python transaction/query params now accept sqlite-style positional
  sequences such as tuples, fixing `tx.execute(..., (value,))`.
- Python wheels now include the Honker SQLite loadable extension and
  expose `honker.extension_info()` / `honker.load_extension(conn)` for
  sqlite3 and ORM-owned connections.

## 2026-05-04 — binding parity release

Release versions:

- `honker-core` / `honker-extension`: 0.2.3
- Python `honker`: 0.2.3
- Rust `honker`: 0.3.3
- Node `@russellthehippo/honker-node`: 0.3.3
- Bun `@russellthehippo/honker-bun`: 0.2.2
- Ruby `honker`: 0.1.2
- Elixir `honker`: 0.1.2
- .NET `Honker`: 0.2.3
- JVM `dev.honker:honker` / Kotlin `dev.honker:honker-kotlin`: 0.1.0

## Unreleased — experimental watcher backends + polling reliability

- New opt-in `watcher_backend` parameter on `honker.open()` (Python +
  Node), `WatcherConfig` (core), and `OpenOptions::watcher_backend`
  (Rust wrapper). Defaults to polling. Two experimental backends added
  behind Cargo features — `kernel-watcher` (notify-rs filesystem events)
  and `shm-fast-path` (mmap'd `-shm` `iChange` read). Source-only in
  published wheels; selecting one without the feature compiled in raises
  instead of silently falling back to polling.
- All maintained bindings now participate in the backend-selection
  contract. Go, Bun, C++, .NET, Ruby, and Elixir accept the polling
  aliases and reject explicit `kernel` / `shm` requests with a
  polling-only error until they consume the shared native watcher ABI;
  unknown backend names are errors everywhere.
- Backend-isolation hooks: Python `queue.claim(..., idle_poll_s=None)`
  and `db.listen(..., fallback_poll_s=None)` plus Node
  `idlePollS: null` / `fallbackPollS: null` disable high-level fallback
  waits. The watcher-backend queue e2e uses this so fallback polling
  cannot make a broken experimental backend look green.
- Polling fix (everyone benefits, no opt-in): `SQLITE_BUSY` /
  `SQLITE_LOCKED` from the watcher's `PRAGMA data_version` poll no
  longer drops the connection. Previously busy → drop → reconnect →
  silently re-baseline `last_version` → missed wakes on non-WAL
  journal modes (DELETE/TRUNCATE/PERSIST). Now: skip the tick, retry
  next pass.
- Python binding now propagates watcher death. When the dead-man's
  switch fires (file replaced, watcher panic), the bridge thread
  pushes a `RuntimeError` sentinel into the consumer's asyncio queue
  so `await update_events()` raises a clear error instead of hanging.
  Node already propagated correctly; no change.
- API hardening: `UpdateWatcher::spawn_with_config` now blocks until
  the background thread has captured its baseline (initial inode for
  polling/kernel, initial `iChange` for shm). Eliminates a race where
  a caller could mutate the file immediately after `update_events()`
  and the watcher would snapshot the post-mutation state as baseline.
- Cross-binding e2e: `test_listener_raises_when_watcher_dies` (Python)
  and `updateEvents().next() rejects when watcher dies` (Node), each
  parameterized over polling/kernel/shm. Skipped on Windows because
  the kernel rejects rename-over-open even with `FILE_SHARE_DELETE`.
- Polling soak: 600 s run on macOS / Apple Silicon under sustained
  ~75 commits/sec. Writer committed 45,269 rows; watcher observed
  45,354 wakes (every commit, plus ~85 init/spurious); `PRAGMA
  integrity_check = ok`. No drift, no leaks observed during the run.
  Kernel and shm have no soak data yet — covered by Phase Atlas.

## Unreleased — in-tree bindings and .NET

- Moved maintained bindings into the main Honker repo as normal
  `packages/` directories. `site/` remains the only submodule.
- Added the official .NET / C# binding under `packages/honker-dotnet`
  with Linux, macOS, and Windows CI plus NuGet packaging smoke tests.
- Root CI now owns the maintained binding checks, including Python,
  Node, .NET, Rust core/extension, aggregate Linux binding smoke, and
  Ruby <-> Python interop.
- Pruned third-party C++ source blobs from the repo. The C++ binding now
  uses package-manager SQLite and `nlohmann-json` dependencies instead
  of vendored SQLite / JSON headers.
- Updated the roadmap so release automation is tracked separately from
  later 1.0 work.

## Unreleased — time-based watcher identity checks

- Switched `UpdateWatcher` file-identity checks from loop-count timing
  to `Instant`-based timing.
- This keeps the dead-man replacement check near its intended cadence
  on platforms where short sleeps round up, especially Windows.
- Tightened the file-replacement regression test now that it no longer
  needs multi-second sleeps to cover timer granularity.

## Unreleased — time-trigger scheduler and wake parity

Moved the completed Phase Timekeeper / time-trigger scheduler work out
of the roadmap.

- `run_at` jobs now wake workers when their deadline arrives instead of
  waiting for a later fallback poll.
- Claim reclaim deadlines now wake sleeping workers on time too, using
  the same next-deadline path as delayed jobs.
- Scheduler expressions now support three forms through the same
  surface:
  - 5-field cron
  - 6-field cron with leading seconds
  - `@every <n><unit>` interval expressions
- Recurring scheduler APIs now converge on `schedule` as the canonical
  name, with legacy `cron` aliases kept where needed for compatibility.
- Maintained bindings now use the same basic time-trigger model:
  update wake or next deadline, with fallback polling only as backup.
- Added real proof for the user-facing behavior:
  live scheduler loop tests, cross-process delayed-job wake tests,
  reclaim-deadline tests, and binding parity coverage across the
  maintained language bindings.
- Simplified binding READMEs so each one teaches the local basics and
  points back to the main Honker docs instead of duplicating the whole
  product README.

## Unreleased — watcher rename and roadmap cleanup

- Finished the public `WalWatcher` -> `UpdateWatcher` rename in the
  core-facing bindings. `honker-core` now exposes `UpdateWatcher` and
  `SharedUpdateWatcher` without deprecated WAL-themed aliases.
- Updated Python, Node, and Rust binding code to import
  `SharedUpdateWatcher` directly.
- Updated package docs, tests, and bench notes to describe the wake
  path as a PRAGMA-backed update watcher rather than a WAL-file stat
  watcher.
- Pruned completed history out of `ROADMAP.md`. Future work remains
  there; shipped correctness/refactor notes live in this changelog.

## Unreleased — pre-launch correctness sweep

Moved the completed Phase Shakedown items out of the roadmap.

- Fixed subscribe-before-first-read races in listener, queue-claim,
  and result-wait paths by subscribing to update events before the
  first state snapshot.
- Fixed scheduler runner processes that had no local registrations:
  `Scheduler.run()` now checks persisted scheduler tasks before
  deciding whether it has work.
- Fixed scheduler wakeup on register/unregister by emitting a reserved
  scheduler notification and racing sleeps against update events.
- Documented listener pruning caveats and scheduler lock
  pause-tolerance.
- Kept resource-bound regression coverage for listener churn and many
  simultaneous listeners.

## Unreleased — binding/core consolidation

- Moved `honker_*` SQL helper registration into `honker-core` so the
  loadable extension, Python binding, and other wrappers share one SQL
  surface.
- Added SQL functions for enqueue, retry, fail, heartbeat, ack,
  scheduler registration/tick, stream publish/read/offset, result
  storage, locks, and rate limits.
- Reworked the Python package into thin context-manager / iterator /
  async glue over the shared Rust SQL functions.
- Moved packages into `packages/` as self-contained directories ready
  for split repositories or submodules.
- Dropped framework plugins from the maintained package set. Framework
  integration now belongs in cookbook examples unless real users ask
  for packaged adapters.

## Unreleased — task result storage

Workers can now persist a handler's return value, and callers can
await the result by job id. Extension-first — the SQL functions
exist in `liblitenotify_ext` so any SQLite client can use them;
Python wraps the same behavior.

### Schema

New `_joblite_results(job_id PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT, created_at,
expires_at)` table in `BOOTSTRAP_JOBLITE_SQL`. Core test pins its
column layout.

### Extension SQL functions

- `jl_result_save(job_id, value_json, ttl_s)` — UPSERTs. ttl_s=0
  means no expiration.
- `jl_result_get(job_id)` — returns value text or NULL (row absent
  or expired).
- `jl_result_sweep()` — deletes expired rows, returns count.

### Python API

- `Queue.enqueue(...)` now returns the inserted `id: int`. Callers
  that previously discarded the return value are unaffected.
- `Queue.save_result(job_id, value, ttl=None, tx=None)` — UPSERT
  via the same table. Accepts a `tx=` so a worker can save the
  result atomically with its ack if it wants to.
- `Queue.get_result(job_id) -> (found: bool, value: Any)` —
  two-tuple disambiguates "None result saved" from "no result".
- `Queue.wait_result(job_id, timeout=None) -> value` — async,
  blocks until saved; wakes on database update so a worker in another
  process finishing the job gets the caller's attention within the
  update-watcher cadence. Raises `asyncio.TimeoutError` on expiry.
- `Queue.sweep_results()` — disk-space reclaim.

### Worker integration

`joblite._worker.run_task` gains `save_result=False` (default off)
and `result_ttl=3600.0`. When enabled, a successful handler's return
value is persisted via `queue.save_result(job.id, value, ttl=...)`
before the ack. Failed handlers save nothing — callers treat
missing-result as did-not-complete.

### Interop guarantees

Extension interop tests pin:
- Extension save → Python read; Python save → Extension read.
- Expired rows filter correctly on both sides.
- UPSERT semantics match.

### Why opt-in

Result storage invites RPC-style patterns; the library's main design
is "enqueue a side effect, worker runs it." `save_result` stays
`False` by default so callers who don't need the RPC shape don't pay
the per-job UPSERT cost. Callers who do need it flip one kwarg.

### Tests

tests/test_task_results.py — 17 tests: enqueue-returns-id, save/get
round trip, UPSERT, rollback inside user tx, expired-filter + sweep,
wait_result immediate / blocks / timeout, run_task integration (on /
off / failed-handler cases), full enqueue→worker→wait_result e2e.

tests/test_extension_interop.py — 5 new tests covering the new
`jl_result_*` functions plus cross-side interop with Python.

166/166 tests pass under parallel pytest.

## Unreleased — extension SQL for Batch 2 + scheduler features

Every feature we added in Batches 2.1-2.3 plus the crontab
scheduler now also exists as SQL functions in the loadable
extension. The Python inline SQL still exists (working code, not
touched), but any SQLite client loading `liblitenotify_ext` gets
the full feature set.

### New SQL functions

| Function                                | Returns  | Mirrors                              |
|-----------------------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| `jl_sweep_expired(queue)`               | count    | `Queue.sweep_expired()`              |
| `jl_lock_acquire(name, owner, ttl_s)`   | 1 / 0    | `Database.lock` context-manager enter|
| `jl_lock_release(name, owner)`          | 1 / 0    | `Database.lock` context-manager exit |
| `jl_rate_limit_try(name, limit, per)`   | 1 / 0    | `Database.try_rate_limit`            |
| `jl_rate_limit_sweep(older_than_s)`     | count    | `Database.sweep_rate_limits`         |
| `jl_scheduler_record_fire(name, at)`    | 0        | `Scheduler._record_fire`             |
| `jl_scheduler_last_fire(name)`          | unix_ts  | `Scheduler._load_last_fires` (one)   |

### Interop guarantees

`tests/test_extension_interop.py` grew 10 new tests that exercise
each new function via `sqlite3` + `.load` and verify the effect on
the shared tables. Cross-side interop tests prove that:

- Python `db.lock("x")` blocks extension `jl_lock_acquire("x", ...)`
  and vice versa (same `_joblite_locks` table).
- Python `db.try_rate_limit("x", 3, 60)` and extension
  `jl_rate_limit_try("x", 3, 60)` share one counter — four calls
  total across both sides fail the fourth.
- Scheduler's `_record_fire` and `jl_scheduler_last_fire` read / write
  the same `_joblite_scheduler_state` row.

### Design notes

- Extracted a `to_sql_err` helper in the extension to cut the
  `UserFunctionError(Box::new(...))` boilerplate from every scalar
  function. Each function is now a ~3-line wrapper around a Rust
  helper that does the SQL.
- The SQL strings live in the Rust helpers (independent of the
  Python inline SQL). Interop tests verify both paths produce the
  same effect on the tables, so they can't silently drift.

### Why now

Two non-Python bindings are on the roadmap (Go, Ruby) plus a
`joblite-node` TypeScript port that wraps `@litenotify/node`.
Every feature the extension exposes as SQL is one less thing each
new binding has to re-implement. New bindings become "load the
extension + pretty-wrap the SQL calls" instead of "port the Queue
class in N languages."

For forward features: extension-first. Task result storage will get
`jl_result_save(id, value, expires_at)` + `jl_result_get(id)` as
its canonical interface; Python wraps those.

## Unreleased — crontab / periodic tasks

Adds `joblite.Scheduler` + `joblite.crontab(expr)` for cron-style
periodic tasks. The scheduler enqueues into a named queue on each
cron boundary; regular workers claim and run the jobs.

    import asyncio
    import joblite
    from joblite import Scheduler, crontab

    db = joblite.open("app.db")
    scheduler = Scheduler(db)
    scheduler.add(
        name="nightly-backup",
        queue="backups",
        schedule=crontab("0 3 * * *"),
        payload={"target": "s3"},
        expires=3600,
    )
    asyncio.run(scheduler.run())

### Design

- **Cron parser is vendored** — a ~100-line 5-field parser (`minute
  hour dom month dow`, with `*`, `*/N`, `N-M`, `N,M,P` syntax). No
  new Python dependencies.
- **Leader election via `db.lock('joblite-scheduler', ttl=60)`.** Two
  scheduler processes can't both fire; the second raises
  `joblite.LockHeld` and callers are expected to retry in a loop
  for hot-standby semantics. Lock is heartbeat-refreshed every 30 s
  during long sleeps so TTL doesn't elapse between fires.
- **Persistence via `_joblite_scheduler_state`** — per-task
  `last_fire_at` so scheduler restart doesn't double-fire a
  boundary that was already dispatched.
- **Missed fires catch up** — if the scheduler was down for 4 hours
  with an hourly schedule, the first iteration after restart fires
  all 4 missed boundaries (with `expires=` in play if the caller
  wants to drop stale ones).
- **Fires = enqueue, not run.** The scheduler never runs handlers.
  Regular workers (spawned however the user wants) consume the
  enqueued jobs like any other job.
- **Scheduler with no registered tasks is a no-op** — doesn't
  acquire the lock, returns immediately. A misconfigured scheduler
  process can't accidentally block real schedulers from running.

### Changes

litenotify-core::BOOTSTRAP_JOBLITE_SQL
  - Add `_joblite_scheduler_state(name PRIMARY KEY, last_fire_at)`
    table.

packages/joblite/_scheduler.py — new module.
  - `_parse_field(field, lo, hi) -> frozenset[int]`.
  - `CronSchedule` with `matches(dt)`, `next_after(dt)`.
  - `crontab(expr) -> CronSchedule`.
  - `Scheduler(db)` with `.add(name, queue, schedule, payload,
    priority, expires)` and `.run(stop_event=None)`.
  - `_fire_due(now, next_fires, last_fires)` as a pure function —
    unit-testable without waiting for real cron boundaries.

packages/joblite/__init__.py
  - Export `Scheduler`, `CronSchedule`, `crontab`.

tests/test_scheduler.py — 26 tests pinning:
  - _parse_field edge cases (any / single / range / step / list /
    combinations / errors for out-of-range and inverted ranges)
  - crontab() field count validation
  - matches() for minute/hour/daily/dow
  - next_after() for hourly / exactly-at-boundary / crosses-day /
    crosses-year
  - Scheduler.add() registration and replace-by-name
  - _fire_due enqueues on boundary, skips already-fired,
    catches up multiple missed boundaries
  - Scheduler.run() integration: stop_event, lock held + release,
    noop-without-tasks, two schedulers → one raises LockHeld

## Unreleased — task queue feature additions (huey parity, minus pipelines)

Six roadmap items landed in two batches. Decorators live on framework
plugins, not on joblite core; the shared `joblite._worker.run_task`
helper centralizes the worker-side enforcement (timeout, retries,
backoff, Retryable) so all features share one implementation.

### Batch 1: decorator surface additions

- **Handler timeout.** Wall-clock bound on handler execution via
  `asyncio.wait_for`. Closes the reclaim-while-still-running
  correctness hole: previously a hung handler's claim would expire
  after `visibility_timeout_s` and another worker would start a
  second copy while the first was still executing side effects.
- **Declarative retries.** `@task(retries=3, retry_delay=60,
  backoff=2.0)` replaces the ad-hoc `try/except: job.retry(60)` each
  plugin had. Exponential backoff: delay for attempt N =
  `retry_delay * backoff**(N-1)`. `Retryable` exceptions honor the
  caller's own `delay_s`, bypassing the formula.
- **`delay=` kwarg on `enqueue`.** Sugar for
  `run_at=time.time() + delay`.

### Batch 2: schema-adding features

- **Task expiration.** `Queue.enqueue(expires=60)` sets an
  `expires_at` column on `_joblite_live`. Claim path filters expired
  rows (extension `jl_claim_batch` too). `queue.sweep_expired()`
  moves them into `_joblite_dead` with `last_error='expired'`.
- **Named advisory locks.** `with db.lock(name, ttl=60): ...` via a
  new `_joblite_locks` table. Raises `joblite.LockHeld` if another
  holder has it; TTL bounds how long a crashed holder can block
  others. Primary use case: cron tasks that shouldn't overlap.
- **Rate-limiting.** `db.try_rate_limit(name, limit, per) -> bool`
  via a new `_joblite_rate_limits` table. Fixed-window counter;
  rejected calls don't inflate the count (hot-loop safe).
  `db.sweep_rate_limits()` reclaims stale windows.

### Restructure

- All language / framework packages moved into `packages/` — each
  subdirectory is self-contained (own `Cargo.toml` /
  `pyproject.toml` / `package.json`) and ready to be split into its
  own GitHub repo + re-added as a git submodule when we're ready to
  authenticate and do the migration.

### Cross-cutting test + infra fixes

- Fixed two parallel-only test flakes (wake-latency p99 using max,
  Django worker SIGINT timeout). Both now pass under `-n auto`.
- `conftest.py` inserts `packages/` into `sys.path` so the pure-
  Python packages are importable from tests without per-package
  `pip install -e`.

## Unreleased — cut framework plugins

Dropped `packages/joblite_fastapi`, `packages/joblite_django`, and
`packages/joblite_flask` (and their three test files) from the repo.

Each was ~300 lines of framework-idiomatic glue wrapping the core
joblite primitives. Useful enough, but every new feature (Batch 1
timeout/retries/delay, Batch 2 expires/lock/rate-limit, upcoming
crontab/results) meant three parallel plugin diffs and three test
sets. For a pre-1.0 library with no real users asking for them, the
maintenance cost outweighed the benefit.

What users can still do:
  - Enqueue in any web handler:
      `with db.transaction() as tx: queue.enqueue(..., tx=tx)`
  - Drive a worker loop with the exposed helper:
      `async for job in queue.claim(worker): await joblite._worker.run_task(job, handler, timeout=..., retries=..., ...)`
  - Write their own SSE view in ~30 lines of
      `yield f"data: {json.dumps(payload)}\n\n".encode()` over
      `db.listen(channel)` or `db.stream(name).subscribe(...)`.

If demand for a packaged version arrives, the plugins will be
re-created as their own GitHub repos (not inline in this monorepo).

Also removed `joblite.build_worker_id` — only the plugins used it.

## Unreleased — API simplifications: `claim()` + `subscribe()`

Two sharp edges filed down based on user review.

### `Queue.claim()` is one-at-a-time

Previously the iterator quietly batched: `batch_size=32`, deferred
ack into `_pending_acks`, pipelined ack-of-previous with
claim-of-next in a single transaction, `Job.ack()` returned
optimistic `True` before the DELETE actually ran. Users reading
`async for job in q.claim(worker_id): handle(job); job.ack()` had
to read the source to understand the tx model.

Now each iteration is `claim_batch(worker_id, 1)` — one row, one
write tx. `Job.ack()` is one DELETE with an honest bool return.
Callers who want batching call `claim_batch(n)` + `ack_batch(ids)`
themselves.

Removed: `batch_size` kwarg on `claim()`, `Queue.ack_and_claim_batch()`
helper, `Job._iter` slot and `_pending_acks` path.

### `Stream.subscribe()` auto-saves offsets on a cadence

Previously callers had to call `stream.save_offset(consumer, offset)`
manually. Per-event saves add one UPSERT per event through the
single-writer slot; forget to call them and consumers replay from 0
every reconnect.

`subscribe(consumer="c")` now auto-flushes the offset at most every
1000 events or every 1 second, whichever first. One UPSERT per
window, not per event — amortizes ~1000× the write traffic on hot
streams. Override with `save_every_n=` / `save_every_s=`; set both
to 0 to disable and save manually (e.g., atomic with a business tx).

At-least-once: the save happens before yielding the next event, so
a handler crash leaves the in-flight offset unsaved and the event
replays on reconnect. Crash window bounded by the thresholds.

Four new tests in `tests/test_stream.py` pin the behavior:
`test_named_consumer_auto_saves_offset_every_n_events`,
`test_named_consumer_auto_saves_offset_every_s_seconds`,
`test_named_consumer_auto_save_disabled`,
`test_named_consumer_crash_replays_from_last_saved_offset`.

### README rewrite

Dropped the Performance table (was measured against the old
pipelined iterator; re-running would chase a moving target for a
question the table couldn't really answer). Replaced with a one-line
"thousands of messages/second, pointer to bench scripts."

Reordered around a quick-start-first flow, added Node + extension
code examples earlier, added a Design goals section, added a
framework plugin walkthrough for each of FastAPI/Django/Flask, and
a Compared-to prose section.

130/130 Python + 8/8 Rust core + 8/8 Node tests pass.

## Unreleased — schema: single-table hybrid (supersedes tables-per-state)

Reverted the tables-per-state split (`_joblite_pending` / `_joblite_processing`
/ `_joblite_dead`) in favor of a single-table hybrid:

- `_joblite_live` — pending + processing rows, with `state` column.
- `_joblite_dead` — terminal rows, separate so retention/truncation
  doesn't touch the hot path.
- `_joblite_live_claim` — partial index
  `(queue, priority DESC, run_at, id) WHERE state IN ('pending', 'processing')`.
- `_joblite_jobs` view — UNIONs live + dead for inspection.

### Why revert

Tables-per-state was 25% slower on direct `claim_one+ack` because
every claim was DELETE+INSERT (2 writes) instead of a single UPDATE.
The partial index on the single-table design already keeps dead rows
out of the claim hot path — none of the "scale flat with history"
property was actually unique to tables-per-state once I measured it
honestly. And the fresh-DB benchmark isn't realistic anyway (no
contention, everything in page cache). Stopped chasing that pattern
and aligned with what the extension already uses.

### Operation mapping (single-table hybrid)

| Op | SQL |
|----|-----|
| enqueue | INSERT INTO _joblite_live (state='pending') |
| claim | UPDATE state='processing' on partial index (1 write) |
| ack | DELETE FROM _joblite_live |
| retry (not exhausted) | UPDATE state='pending', bump run_at (stays in partial index) |
| retry exhausted / fail | DELETE + INSERT INTO _joblite_dead |
| heartbeat | UPDATE claim_expires_at |

### Numbers (fresh DB, median of 3)

| Op | Tables-per-state (prev) | Single-table hybrid |
|----|-------------------------|----------------------|
| claim+ack (direct) | 3.4k/s | 3.9k/s |
| claim_batch+ack_batch (128) | 100k/s | ~110k/s |
| async iter e2e | 7.5k/s | ~5-6k/s (noisy) |

Numbers are close; the real perf test (concurrent workers + DB bigger
than page cache) is still TODO — see ROADMAP.

All 12 Rust + 109 Python tests still pass.

## Unreleased — perf pass 5: tables-per-state schema

The big structural change. `_joblite_jobs` is gone. In its place:
`_joblite_pending`, `_joblite_processing`, `_joblite_dead`, and a
`_joblite_jobs` **view** that UNIONs the three for inspection queries.

### Why

The goal was to make claim performance independent of job history size —
so a long-running worker box doesn't slow down as dead-letter rows
accumulate. Measured: **~132k/s batch=128 claim+ack with 100k dead rows
in the DB, essentially unchanged from a fresh DB.** Single-table with
partial index got most of the way there; tables-per-state gets it the
rest of the way *and* simplifies the schema for the loadable-extension
work coming next.

### Schema

- `_joblite_pending`: hot table, every enqueue appends, every claim
  DELETEs from it. Indexed `(queue, priority DESC, run_at, id)`. No
  state column, no partial predicate, no scanning past claimed rows.
- `_joblite_processing`: in-flight claims. Holds worker_id,
  claim_expires_at, attempts. Touched on claim (INSERT), ack (DELETE),
  retry (DELETE + move to pending/dead), heartbeat (UPDATE). Only
  scanned during the expired-reclaim fallback when pending is empty.
- `_joblite_dead`: terminal. Never scanned on claim. Separate index
  story if you want to aggregate dead-letter data.
- `_joblite_jobs` view: UNION ALL of the three with synthetic `state`
  column. Lets `SELECT state, COUNT(*) FROM _joblite_jobs` keep
  working for inspection. Not used by any hot path.

### Semantic change: `ack()` DELETEs

There's no `state='done'` row after ack anymore. The row is gone from
every table. This means:

- `SELECT state FROM _joblite_jobs WHERE id=?` returns zero rows after
  ack instead of one row with `state='done'`.
- `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM _joblite_jobs` tracks live jobs only.
- If you want audit history, snapshot into your own table.

### Operations

- `enqueue` -> INSERT into pending.
- `claim_batch(n)` -> DELETE RETURNING n rows from pending + INSERT them
  into processing (one INSERT per row via `prepare_cached`; tried
  `WITH moved AS (DELETE RETURNING)` and `INSERT ... SELECT FROM
  json_each` -- SQLite rejects the former; the latter was slower
  because `json_extract` re-parses JSON per column per row).
- `ack` -> DELETE from processing.
- `retry` -> DELETE from processing + INSERT into pending (delayed
  run_at) or into dead (attempts >= max_attempts).
- `fail` -> DELETE from processing + INSERT into dead.
- `heartbeat` -> UPDATE processing.
- Expired-reclaim is opportunistic: if pending is empty, the claim
  query falls back to DELETE RETURNING from processing where
  `claim_expires_at < unixepoch()`. Steady-state workers never pay this
  cost.

### Numbers (median of 3, M-series, release)

Fresh DB, same test shape as previous passes:

| Operation | Pass 4 | Pass 5 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| enqueue (1/tx) | 8.0k/s | 7.5k/s |
| claim + ack (direct) | 4.5k/s | 3.4k/s |
| claim_batch+ack_batch (128) | 110k/s | 100k/s |
| **async iter end-to-end** | **6.5k/s** | **7.5k/s** |

Scaling test (claim+ack on a queue with N dead rows sitting in the
`_joblite_dead` table, same run):

| Dead history | claim_one+ack | batch=128 |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| 0 rows | 4.0k/s | 116k/s |
| 10k rows | 2.8k/s | 134k/s |
| **100k rows** | **3.5k/s** | **133k/s** |

The async-iter pattern (the worker pattern) wins measurably on fresh
DBs and stays flat at scale. Direct `claim_one+ack` regressed ~25%
because it's now two SQL statements per claim (DELETE + INSERT) vs the
old single UPDATE. For real worker loops, use the iterator.

All 12 Rust + 109 Python tests pass. Tests that previously did
`UPDATE _joblite_jobs ...` now target `_joblite_pending` or
`_joblite_processing` explicitly (views aren't updatable in SQLite).

## Unreleased — perf pass 4: pipeline ack+claim, narrow RETURNING, PRAGMA tuning

Three targeted changes. Biggest win by far is the ack+claim pipeline.

### Changes

- **Pipelined ack-of-previous with claim-of-next.** The async iterator
  `queue.claim(...)` now runs both operations in one transaction via
  a new `Queue.ack_and_claim_batch(ack_ids, worker, n)` method.
  `Job.ack()` on iterator-owned jobs appends to a pending-ack list;
  the next batch's claim flushes them in the same tx. Halves the
  write-tx count for the common `async for job: handle; job.ack()`
  pattern. Jobs from direct `claim_one()` / `claim_batch()` still go
  through the old per-tx ack for accurate bool return.
- **Narrow RETURNING on claim.** `claim_batch` now returns
  `id, queue, payload, worker_id, attempts, claim_expires_at` instead
  of `*`. `Job` tolerates a missing row field by defaulting sensibly
  (state='processing', priority=0, etc). Saves ~20% per claim on
  the 11-col RETURNING.
- **PRAGMA tuning.** Added `cache_size=-32000` (32MB page cache, up
  from 2MB default), `temp_store=MEMORY` (temp B-trees for ORDER BY /
  DISTINCT stay in RAM), `wal_autocheckpoint=10000` (fsync every
  10k WAL pages rather than 1k). Cheaper, larger, less frequent
  disk flush.

### Numbers (median of 3, M-series, release)

| Operation | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| enqueue (1/tx) | ~6,000 /s | ~8,000 /s |
| claim + ack (direct) | ~3,700 /s | ~4,500 /s |
| **async iter end-to-end** | **~3,500 /s** | **~6,500 /s** |
| claim_batch+ack_batch (32) | ~60k/s | ~75k/s |
| claim_batch+ack_batch (128) | ~80k/s | ~110k/s |
| async iter p50 latency | ~720ms | ~370ms |

Test suite unchanged: 12 Rust + 109 Python all pass. `Job.ack()` on
iterator-owned jobs returns `True` optimistically (safe within the
millisecond pipeline window); direct callers still get the accurate
`False` return on claim-expired races.

## Unreleased — rename: fold `honker` into `litenotify`, `honk()` -> `notify()`

Architectural cleanup. No functional changes; all 12 Rust + 109 Python
tests still pass with the new names.

- Deleted the `honker/` crate. Its contents now live in
  `litenotify/src/notifier.rs` as a private module inside the
  `litenotify` crate. One crate, one cdylib.
- SQL scalar function `honk(channel, payload)` -> `notify(channel, payload)`,
  parallel to `pg_notify`.
- Rust `Transaction::honk()` and Python `tx.honk()` -> `notify()`.
- All `tx.honk(...)` call sites in `joblite`, tests, bench, and docs
  updated.
- Workspace `Cargo.toml` now has a single member (`litenotify`).

Breaking change for any external caller of `tx.honk(...)`. There aren't
any.

## Unreleased — perf pass 3: try_acquire + deque + lazy JSON + Arc<Notification>

Four targeted changes, each validated by bench. Ordered by impact.

### Changes

- **`collections.deque` for iterator buffers.** `_StreamIter._buffer` and
  `_WorkerQueueIter._buffer` were `list` and yielded via `list.pop(0)`
  which is O(n). Swapped for `deque` + `popleft()` (O(1)). `_StreamIter`
  refreshes in batches of 1000 rows; the old code was spending
  quadratic time shifting each popped row's successors leftward.
- **Writer-mutex `try_acquire` fast-path** on `litenotify.Transaction.
  __enter__`. If the slot is free at `parking_lot::Mutex::lock()` time,
  take it without `py.detach` (saves ~5us/tx of GIL release+reacquire).
  Slow path still drops GIL before blocking on the condvar.
- **Lazy `json.loads` on `Job.payload` / `Event.payload`.** Previously
  `__init__` unconditionally decoded the payload column. Now a
  `@property` decodes on first access via a sentinel-guarded cache.
  Handlers that only read `job.id` / `job.worker_id` skip N JSON parses
  per batch.
- **`Arc<Notification>` in notifier's broadcast channel.** The commit hook's
  fan-out loop cloned a `Notification { channel: String, payload: String }`
  per subscriber. Swapped to `broadcast::Sender<Arc<Notification>>` so
  subscriber sends are ref-count bumps, not `String` reallocations. No
  user-visible change (Python side still copies strings into a
  `NotificationResult` once per delivery, same as before).

### Numbers (median of 3, release build, M-series)

| Operation | Before | After this pass | Pass-1 baseline |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| enqueue (1/tx) | ~5,000 /s | ~6,000 /s | same |
| enqueue (100/tx) | ~94,000 /s | ~110,000 /s | ~45,000 |
| claim + ack | ~3,100 /s | ~3,700 /s | ~1,000 |
| claim_batch+ack_batch (32) | ~48,500 /s | ~60,000 /s | n/a |
| claim_batch+ack_batch (128) | ~61,000 /s | ~80,000 /s | n/a |
| end-to-end (async iter) | ~3,050 /s | ~3,500 /s | ~820 |
| **stream replay** | ~400,000 /s | **~1,000,000 /s** | ~319,000 |
| stream live e2e p50 | 0.24ms | 0.23ms | ~52ms (harness bug) |

All 12 Rust + 109 Python tests still pass.

## Unreleased — perf pass 2: the real claim bottleneck

Previous "perf pass 1" claim was `synchronous=NORMAL` puts us on a fsync
ceiling. Verified with a proper probe (`OFF` vs `NORMAL` vs `FULL`
comparison on the same path): `NORMAL` in WAL does **not** fsync per
commit. The actual claim+ack bottleneck was a query-plan / index-schema
issue hiding behind the misread.

### Root causes

1. **The claim index had `state` as a key column.** Every transition
   `pending -> processing -> done` forced the row to reshuffle in the
   B-tree. Pure CPU cost, nothing to do with disk.
2. **The OR-based WHERE clause couldn't match the partial predicate.**
   Even after rewriting the index as `WHERE state IN ('pending',
   'processing')`, the planner couldn't prove that `(state='pending'
   OR state='processing')` implies the partial index's WHERE, so it
   fell back to a **full table scan** on every claim. `EXPLAIN QUERY
   PLAN` showed `SCAN _joblite_jobs` + `USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY`.

### Fix

- Drop `state` from the index key; keep only `(queue, priority DESC,
  run_at, id)`.
- Make the index **partial**: `WHERE state IN ('pending', 'processing')`.
  Rows drop out of the index entirely on `ack()` / `fail()`, which is a
  cheap single-key delete rather than a B-tree rewrite.
- Add an explicit `state IN ('pending', 'processing')` to the claim
  inner SELECT so the planner matches the partial index. Logically a
  no-op given the OR clause; necessary for planner inference. Plan now
  reads `SEARCH _joblite_jobs USING INDEX _joblite_jobs_claim_v2 (queue=?)`.
- Index renamed `_joblite_jobs_claim_v2`; old `_joblite_jobs_claim`
  dropped idempotently on `Queue._init_schema` for existing DBs.

### New batch APIs

- `Queue.claim_batch(worker_id, n) -> list[Job]`: atomic UPDATE of N
  rows in one tx, one RETURNING *.
- `Queue.ack_batch(ids, worker_id) -> int`: one UPDATE via `json_each`
  over a JSON array of ids, so SQL text is constant across batch sizes
  (prepare_cached hit).
- `Queue.claim(worker_id, batch_size=32)` async iterator now claims in
  batches internally and yields one job at a time. Existing call sites
  (`async for job in q.claim("w1")`) get the batched speed for free.

### Numbers, median of 3, release build, Apple Silicon M-series

| Operation | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| claim + ack (1 job) | ~1,000 /s | ~3,100 /s |
| claim_batch + ack_batch (32) | n/a | ~48,500 /s |
| claim_batch + ack_batch (128) | n/a | ~61,000 /s |
| end-to-end (async iter) | ~820 /s | ~3,050 /s |

All 12 Rust + 109 Python tests still pass with the new schema.

## Unreleased — perf pass 1

Commit-hook path is healthy. Per-tx Python path has a 4x gap to raw
Python `sqlite3` on the same file. Started closing it.

### What changed
- **Prepared-statement cache on all SQL paths.** `run_execute` and
  `run_query` now use `Connection::prepare_cached` instead of
  re-preparing on every call. `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` / `COMMIT` /
  `ROLLBACK` go through a new `run_cached_noparams` helper that also
  hits the cache. Biggest win for batched inserts — 45k/s -> 94k/s
  (100 jobs / tx).
- **Bench harness fix.** `bench/stream_bench.py` now yields between
  publishes (`await asyncio.sleep(0)`), so live e2e p50 reflects the
  library instead of the publish-loop duration. p50 went from ~50ms
  (harness artifact) to 0.24ms (real).

### Honest numbers (median of 3, M-series, release)
- `enqueue` single-tx: ~4.5k/s
- `enqueue` batched (100/tx): ~94k/s
- `claim + ack`: ~1k/s
- `publish` single-tx: ~5.7k/s
- replay: ~400k/s
- live stream e2e: p50 = 0.24ms, p99 = 8ms

### Known remaining gap
Raw Python `sqlite3` is ~47k/s single-tx on the same file; we're at
12k/s for plain `litenotify.tx + execute`. The 4x gap is the PyO3
boundary, the writer-mutex acquire+release, and GIL detach/reacquire.
Uncontended fast path planned — `try_acquire` on the writer mutex so
we skip `py.detach` when the slot is immediately free. Documented in
ROADMAP.

## Unreleased — hardening pass 2

Closes the four test gaps from the previous hardening pass. Test suite:
12 Rust + 109 Python (~12 s parallel).

### What got proven

- **SIGKILL mid-transaction crash recovery.** A subprocess opens the DB,
  starts a `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction (enqueue OR notify inside), is
  `os.kill(pid, SIGKILL)`-ed before COMMIT. Afterwards the file passes
  `PRAGMA integrity_check == 'ok'`, the in-flight write did not land
  (zero rows), a fresh writer can acquire the write lock immediately
  (no stale reserved lock from WAL recovery), and a full enqueue +
  claim + ack round-trip still works. For the notify-bearing case, a
  pre-attached listener sees zero leaked notifications from the killed
  tx, and a subsequent committed notify flows normally.
- **Django management-command concurrency.** Two `python manage.py
  joblite_worker` subprocesses against the same `.db` split 200 jobs
  with zero overlap and both workers participate — proving the
  command's signal handler + task registry + `asyncio.run()` wrapper
  doesn't break the `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` claim exclusivity that
  `test_multiprocess.py` already proved for bare joblite. Synchronized
  with a `READY` handshake so the test isn't flaky on the worker-boot
  race.
- **Django request-level end-to-end.** New tests using
  `django.test.AsyncClient` drive the full request cycle through a
  `FakeUserMiddleware` that sets `request.user`. The authorize callable
  receives the real `request.user` instance the middleware installed,
  not `None` (which the existing RequestFactory-based tests would not
  catch). Last-Event-ID replay works end-to-end through the real
  request pipeline, and the deny path still 403s.
- **Authorize callable policy.** Both `JobliteApp(authorize=fn)` and
  `joblite_django.set_authorize(fn)` now accept sync OR async
  callables. Async is detected by looking at the return value (coroutine
  → `await`), so callables with an async `__call__` also work. If
  authorize raises (sync or async), the exception propagates unchanged
  and the framework returns HTTP 500; the SSE stream is never opened,
  and there is no ambiguous half-open state.

### Policy decisions (user-facing)

- **async authorize:** supported. Upgrade is transparent for existing
  sync callables.
- **authorize raises:** propagates as HTTP 500 in both plugins. Users
  wanting a custom error page should install their framework's normal
  exception handler.

### Tests (23 new)

- `test_crash_recovery.py` (4): SIGKILL-mid-enqueue leaves DB clean,
  SIGKILL doesn't leave a stale write lock, SIGKILL-mid-notify produces
  no phantom notification (fresh listener), SIGKILL-mid-notify produces
  no leak into a pre-attached listener.
- `test_joblite_django.py` (+11):
  - Two-workers management-command concurrency (200 jobs, zero overlap).
  - 3× AsyncClient e2e (stream Last-Event-ID replay through middleware,
    subscribe forwards `request.user` to authorize, deny path still 403).
  - 6× authorize policy (helper unit test for sync/async/raise, 2×
    async deny, 2× raise-returns-500, 1× stream raise-returns-500).
  - Changes `settings.configure(MIDDLEWARE=[...])` to install the
    `FakeUserMiddleware` + adds `urlpatterns` that mount
    `subscribe_sse` and `stream_sse`.
- `test_joblite_fastapi.py` (+8): 4× `_run_authorize` unit tests
  (sync/async truthy/falsy, raise propagates, None passes), 4× HTTP
  integration (async deny-subscribe, async deny-stream, sync/async
  raise-returns-500, stream raise-returns-500).

### Code changes (non-test)

- `joblite_fastapi.joblite_fastapi._run_authorize` (new): evaluates
  authorize; awaits if the return is a coroutine; propagates raises.
  Both SSE paths go through it.
- `joblite_django.views._run_authorize` (new): same contract.
- Docstrings on `JobliteApp` and `joblite_django.set_authorize` document
  the new policy.

## Unreleased — hardening pass

Proves the loudest production claims with tests that would have caught real
bugs. Test suite: 12 Rust + 86 Python (~7 s parallel).

### What got proven
- **Multi-process claim exclusivity.** Two worker subprocesses on the same
  `.db` split 200 jobs with zero overlap; a third process enqueues live
  while two workers drain — every job processed exactly once. This is the
  disk-level BEGIN IMMEDIATE story, previously only proven in-process.
- **Stuck-handler reclaim.** A handler hanging past `visibility_timeout_s`
  releases its claim; another worker reclaims via the atomic claim query;
  the stuck worker's eventual `ack()` returns `False` (at-least-once
  contract visible to the caller). Flip side: a long-running handler that
  heartbeats never gets its claim stolen.
- **Resource bounds under churn.** 300 listener create/consume/drop cycles
  leave thread count within `baseline + 20`; 100 simultaneous listeners
  reap back to baseline after drop; 1000 sustained notifications grow RSS
  by < 50 MB.
- **Real SSE reconnect.** Client reads 4 events, disconnects, reconnects
  with the actual `Last-Event-ID` the server sent, receives the remaining
  replay + new events published during the gap. No duplicates, no gaps,
  ids strictly increasing across the seam.
- **Stream failure modes.** `publish(datetime)`, `Decimal`, `set`, or a
  custom class all raise `TypeError` at publish time — no silent swallow,
  no stale notify left in the transaction buffer. A failed publish followed
  by a valid one still works.

### Tests (12 new)
- `test_multiprocess.py` (3): two-process exclusivity, seeder+worker split
  across processes, live-enqueuer while two workers drain.
- `test_outbox.py` (2): stuck-handler reclaim, heartbeat prevents reclaim.
- `test_resource_bounds.py` (3): listener churn, bounded concurrent
  listeners, sustained notify RSS bound.
- `test_joblite_fastapi.py` (2): real mid-stream reconnect with actual
  Last-Event-ID, reconnect without header replays from start.
- `test_stream.py` (2): non-JSON payload raises, failed publish doesn't
  poison subsequent valid publishes.

## Unreleased — notifier per-channel registry refactor

Fixes two real production issues (thread leak, cross-channel starvation)
with a minimal architecture change. Test suite: 12 Rust + 74 Python
(~7 s parallel).

### What changed
- **notifier::Notifier** now keeps a `HashMap<channel, Vec<Subscriber>>` with
  its own per-subscriber `broadcast::channel(1024)` instead of a single
  shared global channel. `subscribe(channel)` returns a `Subscription`
  with `{id, channel, rx}`; the commit hook fans out only to subscribers
  of the channel the message was notifyed on.
- **New `Notifier::unsubscribe(id)`** removes a subscriber by id and drops
  its broadcast::Sender, which causes any `blocking_recv()` waiting on
  that receiver to return `Closed`. Idempotent.
- **litenotify::Listener** gets a `Drop` impl that calls
  `notifier.unsubscribe(self.subscription_id)` — the bridge thread's
  `blocking_recv` unblocks and the thread exits cleanly.
- **Listener channel filter removed** — the per-channel registry means we
  only receive our own channel's messages, so the old
  `if n.channel == self.channel { continue }` loop is dead code.

### Bugs fixed
1. **Thread leak per SSE connection.** Previously, every `db.listen(...)`
   spawned a bridge thread that lived until the whole `Database` was
   dropped, because all subscribers shared one `broadcast::Sender`.
   An SSE-heavy service would accrue threads with no natural bound.
   Now: Python drops the `Listener`, Drop deregisters the subscriber,
   the Sender for that subscriber drops, blocking_recv returns Closed,
   thread exits.
2. **Cross-channel starvation.** Previously, a single 1024-slot ring was
   shared by all subscribers. A flood on channel `"hot"` would push
   messages out of the ring and force a listener on channel `"cold"` to
   drop its single message (visible as `Lagged(_)`). Now: each subscriber
   has its own ring, and the commit hook only routes to channels that
   have live subscribers.

### Tests (5 new)
- Rust: channel routing does not cross between subscribers; cross-channel
  isolation under 5k "hot" msgs + 1 "cold" msg; unsubscribe frees the slot
  and closes the receiver; unsubscribe of unknown id is a no-op; notify with
  no subscribers is dropped silently.
- Python: cross-channel starvation immunity (3000 "hot" + 1 "cold" still
  delivers); churning 50 short-lived listeners doesn't wedge the notifier.

## Unreleased — Day 3

FastAPI SSE Last-Event-ID replay, joblite-django plugin, benchmark harness.
Test suite: 9 Rust + 72 Python (~8 s parallel).

### Additions
- **joblite-fastapi**: new `GET /joblite/stream/{name}` endpoint that uses
  `db.stream(name).subscribe(from_offset=...)` and parses the SSE
  `Last-Event-ID` header for resume. Each yielded event carries
  `id: {event.offset}` so browsers echo it back on reconnect.
  `_parse_last_event_id` tolerates missing, empty, and malformed headers
  (falls back to `from_offset=0`).
- **joblite-django**: new package. `joblite_django.db()` (lazy), `@task(...)`
  registry, async `stream_sse` and `subscribe_sse` views with
  Last-Event-ID + authorize hook, and `python manage.py joblite_worker`
  management command.
- **joblite core**: `Retryable` moved here so Django and FastAPI plugins can
  share the signal without depending on each other. `joblite_fastapi` still
  re-exports it for import-path compatibility.
- **Benchmark harness** (`bench/`): `joblite_bench.py` (enqueue/claim+ack/
  e2e throughput + latency), `stream_bench.py` (publish/replay/live e2e),
  and a `bench/README.md` with baseline numbers. Scripts are standalone
  (no `PYTHONPATH` needed).

### Fixes
- Bench scripts now insert the repo root into `sys.path` themselves.
- FastAPI e2e SSE test refactored to a shared session-scoped uvicorn server,
  cutting startup cost from ~3× (per-test) to ~1× (per-xdist-worker).

### Scoped out
- **Node bindings + joblite-express**: multi-day chunk (napi-rs + Node-side
  joblite port + express plugin). Deferred to its own branch rather than
  shipping a skeleton — see ROADMAP.

### Tests (18 new)
- joblite-fastapi: stream endpoint replay from Last-Event-ID (real HTTP),
  authorize on stream endpoint, malformed Last-Event-ID → 0, out-of-range
  Last-Event-ID stays 200.
- joblite-django: `db()` lazy-opens and memoizes, raises when
  `JOBLITE_DB_PATH` unset, `@task` registers, `set/get_authorize`, stream
  view returns `StreamingHttpResponse`, authorize blocks both views,
  management command consumes one job then shuts down on SIGINT.

## Unreleased — Day 2 features

Stream + outbox. Test suite: 9 Rust + 51 Python (~2.5 s parallel).

### Additions
- **joblite.stream**: durable pub/sub. `db.stream(name).publish(payload, tx=?)`
  inserts into `_joblite_stream` with an auto-incrementing offset and notifications
  `joblite:stream:{name}`. `subscribe(from_offset=?, consumer=?)` yields
  `Event` objects: replays rows with `offset > from_offset` in batches,
  transitions to live NOTIFY delivery when caught up. Named consumers can
  resume via `save_offset(consumer, offset)` / `get_offset(consumer)`; offset
  saves are monotonic (lower values ignored).
- **joblite.outbox**: transactional side-effect delivery built on `Queue`.
  `db.outbox(name, delivery=fn)` takes a user-supplied sync or async handler.
  `outbox.enqueue(payload, tx=?)` couples the side effect to the business
  write. `outbox.run_worker(worker_id)` drives delivery; failures retry with
  exponential backoff (`base_backoff_s * 2^(attempts-1)`) up to
  `max_attempts`, then land in `dead`.
- `Database.stream(name)` and `Database.outbox(name, delivery=)` are memoized
  like `Database.queue(name)`.

### Tests (14 new)
- Stream: publish/read-back, in-tx atomicity, rollback drops event, monotonic
  offset save, replay→live iterator, `from_offset` skip, named-consumer
  resume, two consumers at different offsets, memoization.
- Outbox: delivery called + acked, retry on exception then success, rollback
  atomicity, in-tx atomicity with business write, memoization.

## Unreleased — Day 1 stabilization

Fixes and tests that close out the Day 1 scope (notifier, litenotify, joblite,
joblite-fastapi). Test suite: 9 Rust + 37 Python (~2 s end to end, parallel).

### Fixes
- **litenotify**: convert Python params to typed `rusqlite::Value`
  (int/float/None/bool/bytes/str) instead of `.str()`-stringifying everything.
  Prior behavior silently broke numeric comparisons, `run_at`/`priority`
  ordering, and any integer math on inserted values.
- **litenotify**: always return the writer connection to the pool in
  `Transaction.__exit__`, even when the body raised, `COMMIT` failed, or the
  object is dropped unclosed. Previously the writer slot leaked on failures.
- **litenotify**: reader/writer pool split. A single dedicated writer
  serializes via `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`; a bounded reader pool
  (`max_readers`, default 8) handles `db.query()` concurrently under WAL.
- **litenotify**: `tx.notify(channel, payload)` now accepts `dict`/`list`/`str`
  and `json.dumps`-encodes non-string payloads to match the plan's API.
- **notifier**: documented inline that `commit_hook` does NOT fire for
  `BEGIN DEFERRED` transactions with no writes (SQLite fast-paths them).
  Library contract requires `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`; regression test locks it in.
- **litenotify Listener bridge**: replaced `pyo3_async_runtimes::future_into_py`
  with a `std::thread` that does `broadcast::blocking_recv` and then
  `loop.call_soon_threadsafe(queue.put_nowait, notif)` at delivery time. The
  previous bridge was statically bound to pyo3-async-runtimes' runtime, so
  any embedder running on a different asyncio loop (starlette's TestClient
  portal, anyio portals, Jupyter kernels) saw listeners silently hang. The
  new bridge captures the running loop at `__aiter__` time and works on any
  asyncio event loop. Drops the `pyo3-async-runtimes` dependency.
- **joblite**: `Queue.heartbeat(job_id, worker_id, extend_s)` extends the
  claim only when `worker_id` matches and state is `processing`.
- **joblite**: `joblite.open(path)` now returns a wrapper with
  `db.queue(name, ...)` (memoized) so the plan's advertised API actually
  works.
- **joblite-fastapi**: `JobliteApp(authorize=fn, subscribe_path=...,
  user_dependency=...)` plus a `GET {subscribe_path}` SSE endpoint that
  bridges `db.listen()` and honors the authorize callable.
- **joblite-fastapi**: worker loops now distinguish `Retryable` (scheduled
  retry) from other exceptions (also retry, but with a generic 60 s delay
  and the traceback in `last_error`).

### Tests

**Rust (notifier)** — 9 tests:
- rollback drops pending notifications
- commit fans out one copy per subscriber
- multiple subscribers each receive every notification
- multiple notifications in one tx deliver in order
- savepoint partial rollback behavior is documented
- full rollback drops everything, even after savepoints
- unicode + 1 MB payload round-trip
- subscribe-before-attach is safe
- `BEGIN DEFERRED` read-only transaction loses notifications (locked-in contract)

**Python litenotify** — 16 tests covering param type fidelity, numeric
comparisons, unsupported types, listener channel isolation, multi-listener
fanout, rollback-drops-notification, dict/list payloads, connection pool release on
success/rollback/body-exception/commit-error, slow listener not blocking the
commit hook, `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` under concurrent writers (3 threads × 20
writes), readers concurrent with a held writer, reader pool for `db.query()`,
and PRAGMA verification.

**Python joblite** — 15 tests. All six PLAN must-pass cases covered:
two workers racing on `claim()` → one winner; expired claim loses ack and is
reclaimable; heartbeat rejects mismatched `worker_id`; `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`
under concurrent readers; plus priority, delayed `run_at`, max_attempts →
dead, fail → dead, rollback drops enqueue, worker wakes on NOTIFY (< 2 s vs
5 s polling fallback), and queue memoization.

**Python joblite-fastapi** — 6 tests: worker boot/shutdown, request-tx
atomicity (business rollback drops the job), `Retryable` flow retries then
dies, SSE auth rejects (403), user-dependency is forwarded to the authorize
callable, and an end-to-end SSE delivery test against a real uvicorn
subprocess (sync TestClient + httpx ASGI transports both buffer streaming
chunks in a way that never delivers the first event — this is a harness
limitation, not a library one, so we run a real HTTP server).
