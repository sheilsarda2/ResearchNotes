# Single source of truth for the C++ wrapper source filenames. Used by:
#   - cpp/CMakeLists.txt (in-tree build; splits the buckets into separate OBJECT
#     libs so generated code can disable clang-tidy and RA code can be conditional)
#   - cpp/cmake/foxglove-sdk-dist-config.cmake (dist; consumers compile the union
#     of handwritten + generated into one wrapper library, with the RA source added
#     when REMOTE_ACCESS is on)
#
# Each list contains bare filenames; consumers prepend their own source root.
#
# Add new source files here. The in-tree build and the dist both pick them up.
